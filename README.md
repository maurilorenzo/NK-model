# NK-model
## simple NK model with sticky prices and imperfect information

Simple NK model used to study the effects of price stickyness and imperfect information on real and nomila quantities via a montecarlo simulation.

To run the algorithm run ```NK.md ```

For the analytical derivation of the model and the comments on the results see ***analysis#7***
